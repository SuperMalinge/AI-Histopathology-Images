# Histopathology Analysis CNN

A deep learning model for automated histopathology image analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks. This model excels at cancer cell detection, tissue classification, and morphological analysis of microscopy images.

## Features

- Cancer cell detection and segmentation
- Multi-class tissue classification 
- H&E stain normalization
- High-resolution image processing (1024x1024)
- Real-time visualization of detection results
- Specialized CNN architecture for cellular patterns
- Support for common microscopy formats (.tif, .png)

## Clinical Applications

- Cancer cell identification
- Tissue type classification
- Cellular pattern recognition
- Morphological analysis
- Quantitative pathology
- Research and diagnostics support

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-image
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV (for image processing)
